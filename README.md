## Installation
Copy the folders to your 3ds max root directory.

## Improvments
3ds max file list can be sorted by name or by date.

Scripts can have a short description and a flag for reminding the user whether to run the script with saving option or without.
These setting are set at the beginning of the script file with commented strings:
```
--batchitInfo: Short script description
--batchitSave: true | false
```
